This project is regarding a Lasso Regularized Logistic Regression model intended to detect covid-19 from Raman spectroscopy. 

Motivation 

The principal diagnosis method for SARS-CoV-2 is a PCR technique, which allows for the detection of a genetic material of a pathogen or microorganism and it has high specificity, sensitivity and helps diagnosing even in the first stages of infection. However, it is not the fastest method to use in this situation and it's very time consuming.

Raman spectroscopy could be used as a cheap and quick method to diagnose infection by SARS-CoV-2.
